This is the mcdonalds clone.
It is deployed on firebase. You can check out the clone via --> https://mcdonalds-clone-d0bb8.firebaseapp.com/

I have used React, tailwind css for making this clone.
The main aim of this project was to implement responsiveness of the website.
Tailwind CSS makes it much more simple to design web pages according to the screen sizes and many more.
The main focus was on the frontend and not on the backend.
